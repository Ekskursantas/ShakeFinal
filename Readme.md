In the Sort package you can find the implementation of different sorting algorithms which will sort all the words from Shakespear alphabetically. The is a StopWatch to measure the difference in each of the algorithms.

In the Search package you can find the implementation of different ST searching algorithms for the Shakespear works. For it to work you need to give your shakespear.txt location because I did not include the works in the package (I think)
